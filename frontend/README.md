# CycleVale Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

CycleVale's frontend is built using React, designed to offer a seamless and intuitive e-commerce experience for bicycle enthusiasts. It features a responsive design, ensuring compatibility across all devices and screen sizes. Users can browse a wide range of bicycles, accessories, and gear, view detailed product descriptions, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

## Contributing
Please read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## License

## IMP
This template covers the basics for a frontend README file, including an overview of the project, how to set it up and run it, the folder structure, packages used, and installation instructions. You may need to customize the README to fit your project's specific requirements, such as including instructions for environment setup, detailing more about the project's features, or providing additional scripts used in the project (like `npm run build` for building a production version of the app).



## Extra Resources

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
